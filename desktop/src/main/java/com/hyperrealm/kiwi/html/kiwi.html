<b>Version 2.3.1</b> - February, 2008

<p>
    Kiwi is a collection of class libraries that simplifies
    application development under Java using the Java Foundation
    Classes (JFC).
</p>

<p>
    Kiwi dates back all the way to 1998, when I was just
    starting out with Java development. I was learning Swing at the
    time, and began to work on a class library that would make
    writing Swing applications easier. I felt that other people in
    the development community would also find the library useful, so
    I eventually released Kiwi 1.1 as an open source project.
</p>

<p>
    Since then, I have continued to develop Kiwi in my spare
    time. Since I use Kiwi in all of my other Java projects, this
    development is largely driven by the requirements of those
    projects. The end result is that Kiwi contains functionality
    that is actually useful in real applications; gratuitous
    features are kept to a minimum.
